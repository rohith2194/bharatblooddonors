       <p style="margin-left:10%;">Well, it&#39;s pretty simple! The first step of our mission, is to collect the entire database of NITW. We will try to expand to other colleges at a later stage. The website works on a &#39;Pin-code&#39; based search process. When a patient approaches us, we ask for the following details
        <br>Blood Group.
        <br>Location (pin code).<br>
We then give them a list of donors, in that location of that particular blood group.
We have a wide vision to lay fore-roads and bring many colleges onto the platform. We know it takes time. But we are dedicated!
Another additional feature we pose is the &#39;SMS at the GO&#39; option. It will of course be made available only to selected representatives from each class of the college. This feature is included, keeping in mind the future scope and is aimed to ease the pressure of the recipient at times of urgency.
We are totally dedicated to help the needy and we give due respects to your privacy. We do not display the contact details of girls unless the are okay with it. &#39;SMS at the GO&#39; option will be helpful to reach girls, for in-case your numbers aren&#39;t displayed.
